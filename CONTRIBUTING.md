# Enzyme Protocol Contribution Guidelines

As an open source project, we will consider changes to the code base from the community via pull requests. This document contains the guidelines for submission.

## Requesting permission to contribute

Currently, all active development happens in a private development repo, which is then pushed to the public repo as releases and extended functionality are brought into production.

We are working on a structure for general community contributions.

In the meantime, those who wish to contribute to Enzyme should reach out to the Enzyme Council with a proposal for how they would like to contribute: [council@enzyme.finance](mailto:council@enzyme.finance)

All pull requests must be made against the private development repo.

## Git Branching Model

We essentially follow the principles of this [Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), where `master` is replaced by `current` and `develop` is replaced by `next`.

`current` is the branch with the smart contracts that represent the full current release active on Ethereum mainnet.

`next` is the branch under active development, which will become the next release on Ethereum mainnet.

Because releases are dependent on deployed smart contracts, the only kinds of code that can be merged directly into `current` are new contracts that do not depend on changes to already-deployed production code (e.g., a new DeFi adapter or a new derivative price feed), or changes to non-production code (e.g., docs or additional test coverage necessary to accompany new contracts).

Any breaking changes to production contracts should be introduced by branching off of `next`.

Each branch name should be prefixed with either `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `chore/`, `test/`, or `docs/` depending on the type of work that is being done:

- `feat/my-branch` (for code that adds new contract functionality, production contracts only)
- `fix/my-branch` (for fixing existing contracts, production contracts only)
- `refactor/my-branch` (for refactoring contracts, production contracts only)
- `chore/my-branch` (for any work on non-production contracts, linters, deployment utils, etc)
- `test/my-branch` (for adding, fixing, or updating tests and test helpers)
- `docs/my-branch` (for documentation additions or changes)

## Issues, pull requests and reviews

Anybody can open a new issue, which will be reviewed by a maintainer.

Before creating a pull request (PR), please first open a new issue describing the problem to be resolved and await a response from a maintainer.

Pull requests should either be made into `current` or `next`, depending on if the PR is extending the current release or the next release, respectively. If you do not know which branch to base the PR against, please consult a maintainer.

When making a pull request (PR), please:

- Follow the "Git Branching Model" outlined in this document
- Follow the "Style Guide" outlined in this document
- Add tests that cover newly introduced code
- Format your code (using prettier) by running `yarn format`
- Lint your code (using solhint) by running `yarn lint`
- Write a thorough description about the purpose and implementation of the PR
- Make a comment in the PR that includes any breaking changes to solidity code

When a pull request is created, one of the maintainers will review the code, and incorporate it into the relevant branch.

## Style Guide

The purpose of this style guide is to increase consistency within and between our contracts.
This makes them more legible, thereby helping maintain a high level of security.

### Tools

Some of our style choices are enforceable by a linter and formatting rules.

Using a linter is not a substitute for understanding the style guide, however, since some of our style choices do not have rules that can be enforced by these linters yet.

#### Solhint

We use [solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint) for linting Solidity code. We extend solhint's [recommended rules](https://github.com/protofire/solhint/blob/master/docs/rules.md) with a few of our own, which can be found in `.solhint.json`.

#### Prettier

We use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) for formatting both Solidity and TypeScript code, in order to standardize formatting practices. It is recommended to install a plugin for your text editor such as [this one](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode) for VSCode, which can be configured to apply formatting on save.

### Solidity

Please adhere to the recommended [official Solidity style guide for v0.6.12](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.12/style-guide.html), in addition to the following styling choices:

#### State variables

- All state vars and all functions should be `private` by default, unless they are meant to be inherited (in which case they are `internal`)
- State getter functions should be named as `getXXX`
- State setter functions should be named as `setXXX`
- All state vars that should be easily verifiable (most state vars) should have a simple getter

#### Functions

- Function, modifier, and event _parameters_ are _prefixed_ with an underscore, e.g., `_myParameter`
- Function, modifier, and event _return values_ are _suffixed_ with an underscore, e.g., `myReturnValue_`
- Always use named return values, but also always explicitly use `return`, i.e., `return (myValue1_, myValue2_)`. It is redundant, but it is performant and easier to review explicit return values.
- Non-externally visible _functions_ (`internal` and `private` visibility) are _prefixed_ with a double underscore, e.g., `__myInternalFunction()`
- Functions that perform and return calculations should be named as `calcXXX`
- Functions that verify conditions and return a boolean should be named as `isXXX`

#### Interfaces

- An `interface` for a contract should be prefixed with an `I`, e.g., `IMyContract`
- Interface files should only include the minimal functions that are required by other protocol contracts. They are not complete representations of the contract interface.
- Any contract that has functions that are dependencies of other contracts must inherit an interface and `override` the required functions, i.e., `MyContract is IMyContract`.

#### Natspec comments

We use [Natspec](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Natural-Specification-Format) annotations, which can be parsed to generate documentation.

We use thorough Natspec annotations for all externally-visible functions (i.e., `external` and `public`), and generally only a simple `@dev` annotation for internally-visible functions (i.e., `internal` and `private`).

We use `///` for multi-line comments rather than `/* */`.

Do not include `@notice` or `@dev` multiple times in the same block.

Annotations should be in this order:

```solidity
/// @notice Send tokens to another address, and get back the balances before/after balances
/// @param _toAddress The address to receive funds
/// @return oldBalance_ The balance before sending funds
/// @return newBalance_ The balance after sending funds
/// @dev Some comment intended for developers
function sendFunds(address _toAddress) external
    returns (uint256 oldBalance_, uint256 newBalance_)
{
    oldBalance_ = balance;
    ...
    newBalance_ = __calcNewBalance(oldBalance_);
}

/// @dev Helper to calculate the new balance after sending funds
function __calcNewBalance(uint256 _oldBalance) private
    returns (uint256 newBalance_)
{
    ...
}
```

#### Misc

- Max line length: 99
- `require()` statements must include a helpful message
- Data types should be explicitly defined, e.g., `uint256` instead of `uint`

Should there no explicitly mentioned rule please follow the _[GOLDEN RULE](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/blob/b6218fc1da39994043f1c43185bb24e364382d84/CodingStandards.txt#L3): Follow the style of the existing code when you make changes._
